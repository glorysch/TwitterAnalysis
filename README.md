# TwitterAnalysis

This project was done for my final project in Big Data Platforms at The University of Chicago Master's of Analytics program. 
<br/>First, I subset 2TB+ of twitter user data by filtering it using Google Cloud Platforms to pull out data only pertaining to four schools of my choosing. 
After subsetting the data I utilized Jupyter Notebooks on my local laptop to analyze the data. 

I utilized various packages in Python such as:<br/>
-Basemap<br/>
-nltk<br/>
-SimHash<br/>
-re<br/>
-Pandas<br/>
-NumPy<br/>
-matplotlib<br/>
-Seaborn<br/>
-Geopy<br/>


The purpose of this project was to compare twitter users from other universities to that of U Chicago users and make recommendations on social media influence through Twitter.
